# Judd

## What is this?
Judd is a multiplayer results server. It is named after Judd, the cat who judges multiplayer matches in Splatoon 1

Some titles will upload multiplayer match result data to a central server. Currently the only known title to do this is Splatoon for Splatfest results. This server is designed in a way to allow other titles to be added in the future if need be as a generic results server
